                The Pokémon world (Japanese: ポケモンの世界 Pokémon world) is the main planet for the Pokémon franchise, set in the Pokémon universe. It bears some striking similarities with the real world, certainly deriving inspiration from it, but many factors set it apart as a different place from our own world. The world of Pokémon is based on Japanese culture but various other cultures are also added and mixed.

                The Kanto region (Japanese: カントー地方 Kantō-chihō) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is located east of Johto, and as revealed by the radio show Sinnoh Sound, is located south of Sinnoh. It was the first region to be introduced. It is the setting of the Generation I games and FireRed and LeafGreen; it is also accessible in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver after the quest in Johto is completed.

It is located west of Kanto, and as revealed by the radio show Sinnoh Sound, is located south of Sinnoh. It is the setting of Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. Johto and Kanto are part of a large landmass, with everything west of Indigo Plateau falling in the Johto region.

                The Hoenn region (Japanese: ホウエン地方 Hōen-chihō) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is located south of Sinnoh. It is the setting of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire. It is inspired by the real-world Japanese main island of Kyushu. The names of most of the cities in Hoenn are made of two words put together (Little Root, Fort Tree, Slate Port, Ever Grande, etc.) rather than colors or plants as Kanto and Johto had done.

                The Sinnoh region (Japanese: シンオウ地方 Shin'ō-chihō) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is located north of Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn. It is the setting of Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. It is composed of the large mainland, the north-eastern island of the Battle Zone, and several smaller islands on both sides of the region.
                Most of Sinnoh's routes are on land, having very few water routes, in vast contrast to Hoenn. The region is divided by Mt. Coronet, roughly comparable to how the continent that Kanto and Johto make up is essentially a contiguous region.

                The Unova region (Japanese: イッシュ地方 Isshu-chihō) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is the setting of Pokémon Black and White and Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. It is far away from the four other large regions, and the Pokémon which inhabit Unova are diverse and different from those of Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh. In his director's column, Junichi Masuda suggested that the geographical and social background for Unova draws inspiration from the New York City metropolitan area.

                Kalos (Japanese: カロス地方 Kalos-chihō) is a region of the Pokémon world. It is the setting of Pokémon X and Y. It is based on the northern portion of France.
                The Kalos region is shaped like a five-pointed star, with one of its biggest cities being Lumiose City in the north-central part of the region. It features a vast network of rivers and waterways snaking through much of its landscape, cities and towns. North-east of Lumiose City lies a mountain range where more frigid temperatures exist, extending down into the plains below. Western Kalos features a vast ocean, where the shore side city of Shalour City lies in the middle of a cove.
